    <section id="overview">
      <h2 style="color: #00f;">Overview</h2>
      <p>The RS rides as well as a Carrera on sports suspension; the steering is no heavier, and the car we drove featured air-con (a no-cost option) and sat-nav. Find an open road, though, and it comes alive: the steering is superb, the damping exceptional, and the engine just keeps pulling.</p>
      <p>How reliable is the Porsche GT2 RS?</p>
      <p>________________________________</p>
      <p>Porsche has worked hard to increase reliability and is now starting to build a reputation for itself as a highly dependable brand in today's luxury car market. While there have been multiple tweaks to the engine, the basic design is now the power behind the second generation of the 911, which has already proved reliable.</p>
